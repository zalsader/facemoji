# Facemoji
Find emoji by expressing yourself.

Facemoji makes texting much more fun and active than before. Can't find the right emoji to express yourself? Rather than frowningly scrolling through an endless list of emojis on your keyboard, Facemoji lets you pick an emoji while texting by expressing your own emotions. Simply open your camera and let Facemoji interpret your emotions in emoji form. Facemoji now correctly recognizes ðŸ˜€, ðŸ˜­, as well as other emotions and facial features. 

We plan to expand Facemoji to recognize many more emotions and facial features, include object emoji, and eventually complete the whole set of unicode emoji. Right now, the recognition is done online, but with the recent improvements in mobile hardware we plan to make our app work offline, too.
